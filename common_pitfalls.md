# Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting Guide

This document outlines common issues with elevator and slider mechanisms in FTC robots, their causes, and solutions.

## Performance Issues

### 1. Mechanism Stalls or Moves Slowly

#### Symptoms
- Motor struggles or stalls when lifting
- System moves much slower than expected
- Motor gets hot quickly
- High current draw

#### Causes
- Insufficient gear ratio (not enough torque)
- Underpowered motor for the application
- Excessive friction in the system
- Higher load than calculated
- Voltage drop due to low battery

#### Solutions
- **Increase gear ratio**: Add additional reduction to increase available torque
- **Upgrade motor**: Consider a higher-torque motor if space allows
- **Reduce friction**: Check for binding, misalignment, add lubrication
- **Lighten the mechanism**: Use lighter materials, optimize design
- **Check power delivery**: Use appropriate wire gauge, check connections
- **Battery management**: Ensure fully charged battery during competitions

### 2. System is Too Slow

#### Symptoms
- System works reliably but too slowly for competition needs
- Movements take longer than expected to complete

#### Causes
- Excessive gear reduction
- Inefficient motion system
- Poor programming (slow acceleration profiles)

#### Solutions
- **Reduce gear ratio**: Find the optimal balance between speed and torque
- **Optimize friction points**: Better bearings, alignment
- **Improve motion profile**: Adjust acceleration curves in software
- **Consider different mechanism design**: Sometimes a complete redesign with different principles may be more efficient

## Mechanical Issues

### 3. Binding and Jerky Motion

#### Symptoms
- Mechanism gets stuck at certain positions
- Movement is not smooth
- Unusual noises during operation

#### Causes
- Misalignment of rails or slides
- Debris in slides or tracks
- Deformation under load
- Uneven tension in cables/chains

#### Solutions
- **Improve alignment**: Ensure parallel rails and proper spacing
- **Clean and maintain regularly**: Remove debris, apply appropriate lubrication
- **Add guide wheels or bearings**: Provide additional support points
- **Reinforce structure**: Add cross-bracing to prevent flexing
- **Balance tension**: Ensure even tension on all cables/chains

### 4. Cable/Chain Issues

#### Symptoms
- Skipping or jumping during operation
- Uneven movement
- System loses position
- Cables go slack or chains derail

#### Causes
- Insufficient tension
- Improper routing
- Wear over time
- Pulley/sprocket misalignment

#### Solutions
- **Add tensioners**: Spring-loaded or adjustable tensioners
- **Improve routing**: Use guide pulleys to maintain proper engagement
- **Regular inspection**: Check for wear and replace worn components
- **Secure attachment points**: Ensure cables/chains are properly secured
- **Use appropriate components**: Match chain/cable system to the load requirements

### 5. Structural Weakness

#### Symptoms
- Bending or flexing under load
- Progressive degradation of performance
- Components breaking during operation

#### Causes
- Undersized structural elements
- Poor material choice for load requirements
- Stress concentration at mounting points
- Vibration causing fastener loosening

#### Solutions
- **Strengthen critical components**: Use stronger materials or larger profiles
- **Add bracing**: Cross-bracing for tall structures
- **Distribute loads**: Spread attachment points to reduce concentrated stress
- **Use appropriate fasteners**: Lock nuts, thread locker for vibration resistance
- **Perform FEA**: Consider finite element analysis for critical components

## Electrical and Control Issues

### 6. Inconsistent Positioning

#### Symptoms
- Position drifts over time
- Cannot reliably reach the same position
- Overshooting or undershooting targets

#### Causes
- Encoder issues or lack of position feedback
- Slipping mechanical connections
- Controller tuning problems
- Program logic errors

#### Solutions
- **Implement closed-loop control**: Use encoders for position feedback
- **Check mechanical connections**: Ensure no slipping between motor and mechanism
- **Tune PID parameters**: Properly tune the control loop
- **Add limit switches**: Use for position calibration
- **Create position presets**: Define specific known positions in code

### 7. Unexpected Current Spikes

#### Symptoms
- Circuit breakers tripping
- Brownouts on other robot systems
- Motor controllers resetting

#### Causes
- Mechanical binding causing current spikes
- Trying to lift too much weight
- Aggressive acceleration in code
- Damaged motors or controllers

#### Solutions
- **Implement current limiting**: Use software current limiting features
- **Smooth acceleration**: Use gradual acceleration profiles
- **Check for binding**: Resolve mechanical issues causing resistance
- **Verify load calculations**: Ensure system is properly sized for the load
- **Use appropriate power distribution**: Separate power feeds for high-current mechanisms

## Design Methodology Issues

### 8. Over-engineering

#### Symptoms
- Mechanism is excessively complex
- Difficult to maintain or adjust
- Takes too long to build and test
- Consumes too many resources

#### Causes
- Trying to accomplish too many goals with one mechanism
- Adding features "just in case"
- Not focusing on the core requirements

#### Solutions
- **Simplify the design**: Focus on core functionality first
- **Build incrementally**: Start with minimum viable product, add features later
- **Test early and often**: Get real-world feedback before proceeding
- **Set clear priorities**: Know which requirements are essential vs. optional

### 9. Under-engineering

#### Symptoms
- Mechanism fails under expected loads
- Premature wear or breakage
- Does not meet competition requirements

#### Causes
- Insufficient testing
- Cutting corners on critical components
- Underestimating loads or duty cycle

#### Solutions
- **Apply appropriate safety factors**: Use 1.5-2x safety factor for calculations
- **Worst-case testing**: Test with worst-case loading scenarios
- **Progressive loading**: Test with increasingly demanding conditions
- **Seek peer review**: Have others review your design and calculations

## Testing and Validation Issues

### 10. Poor Testing Methodology

#### Symptoms
- Issues discovered during competition
- Inconsistent test results
- False confidence in system reliability

#### Causes
- Testing in ideal conditions only
- Not testing with realistic loads
- Insufficient test cycles for wear issues
- Not testing edge cases

#### Solutions
- **Create a testing protocol**: Define specific tests that validate requirements
- **Stress testing**: Test beyond expected conditions
- **Longevity testing**: Cycle the mechanism many times to identify wear issues
- **Simulate competition conditions**: Battery at different charge levels, different operator skill levels
- **Test all software modes**: Manual control, autonomous, emergency recovery

## Workflow and Process Improvements

### Implementing Design-Build-Test Cycles

1. **Start small**: Begin with a simple prototype that tests core functionality
2. **Validate calculations**: Compare actual performance to calculated values
3. **Iterate quickly**: Make small changes and test immediately
4. **Document everything**: Keep records of what works and what doesn't
5. **Schedule time for rebuilds**: Plan for at least one major redesign in your timeline

### Before Competition Checklist

- [ ] Verify all fasteners are tight and secured with thread locker where appropriate
- [ ] Run the mechanism through its full range of motion with varying loads
- [ ] Check current draw at different positions and loads
- [ ] Verify position control and repeatability
- [ ] Test operation with low battery conditions
- [ ] Have spare critical components ready
- [ ] Ensure operators are trained on normal operation and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures for between matches

### Emergency Field Repair Kit

- Spare motors and motor controllers
- Replacement chains, cables, or belts
- Common fasteners (screws, nuts, shaft collars)
- Alignment tools
- Lubricant
- Cable ties and tape for temporary fixes
- Basic tools for quick disassembly/reassembly

Remember that the most common cause of elevator/slider mechanism failures in FTC is insufficient testing under realistic conditions. Always test your mechanism with the actual loads it will encounter, through its entire range of motion, and for many cycles before considering it competition-ready.
